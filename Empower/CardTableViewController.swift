To solve the brain\'s mysteries, you often have to break a problem down to a simpler form...We want to see the interconnected nerves that give rise to thoughts, actions, and emotions.\"\n\nCori Bargman has never been known to shy away from the complex. Tackling the most difficult questions and part of the body, the brain, Cori\'s lab at Rockefeller University focuses on the role of individual genes in brain development and function. Broadening our understanding of the human brain, her work uses the roundworm C. elegans as a model to map neural circuits and to investigate the role of individual genes on behavior. In fact, President Obama named her co-chair to the Brain Research Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative, an endeavour that investigates the causes of brain conditions such as Alzheimer\'s, autism, and depression by understanding the connections between brain function and behavior.\n\nEducation:\nPh.D. Cancer Biology (MIT)\nB.S.
